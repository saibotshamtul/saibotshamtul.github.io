# codeskulptor
This site is an alternative user interface for Codeskulptor. 
It hides the python code and only displays a run button, a reset button, and a console.

You can take any Codeskulptor code url, such as 

http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user31_JSgVaJRlzS_0.py

and convert it to 

http://saibotshamtul.github.io/www.codeskulptor.org/#user31_JSgVaJRlzS_0.py
